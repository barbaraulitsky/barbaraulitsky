## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“ˆ I am a Business Intelligence Developer at an online learning management company in Canada. I work with SQL Server and an XML-based Business Intelligence tool, Logi Analytics. I build queries, stored procedures, and dashboards. Previously, I was a Data Analyst at Shopify, where I gained hands-on experience with Python, Apache Spark, and several SQL databases. I recently completed MIT's online MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science, which deepened my knowledge and skills in machine learning and statistical modelling.

ðŸš€ I have a robust skill set in data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence tools. My SQL expertise spans MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Presto, SQL Server, and SQLite. I am adept with Business Intelligence platforms such as Tableau, MS PowerBI, Logi, Cognos, and Mode, alongside Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. I also have experience with Apache Spark (PySpark, Spark SQL, Spark MLlib), Git/GitHub, ETL workflows, and Regular Expressions. Additionally, I have substantial experience in Google Colab, Jupyter and Databricks notebooks, as well as XML and CSS.

ðŸ”­ I am actively exploring new roles - ideally in data science - but I am equally open to opportunities in data analysis or business intelligence, where I can continue growing and applying my technical expertise.

ðŸ“š Outside of work, I love cooking, reading books and going for a walk.
